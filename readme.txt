Develop a Python-based simulation of an IoT temperature monitoring system that tracks real-time data and alerts users when readings fall outside of pre-defined safety limits.

sample output1 
Enter minimum temperature: 20
Enter maximum temperature: 80
Monitoring started... (Ctrl+C to stop)
Current Temp: 45 - Temperature is within acceptable limit
Current Temp: 72 - Temperature is within acceptable limit
Current Temp: 15 - Alert: Temperature is too low
Current Temp: 88 - Alert: Temperature is too high
Current Temp: 50 - Temperature is within acceptable limit


Sample output 2:-
Enter minimum temperature: 40
Enter maximum temperature: 60
Monitoring started... (Ctrl+C to stop)
Current Temp: 32 - Alert: Temperature is too low
Current Temp: 55 - Temperature is within acceptable limit
Current Temp: 91 - Alert: Temperature is too high
Current Temp: 42 - Temperature is within acceptable limit
